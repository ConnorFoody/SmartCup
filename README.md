Goldilocks
========

We made a cup that tells you when your coffee will be at just the right temperature. 

An arduino measures the temperature of the liquid in the cup and sends it to an Android app wirelessly via bluetooth. 

The app calculates when your coffee will be comfortable to drink and provides estimates of when your drink will be ready.
